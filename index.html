            <h2>Coding and Pet Lover</h2>
            <p>I am a full-stack web developer having more than 1 years of experience and having good knowledge of
                front-end and back-end techniques for building web applications that match client needs. I have
                developed some web applications from scratch but at the same time, I manage and update the client?s
                existing projects also as I have outstanding debugging skills. I love my dog as well. Because, my Dog
                are just natural comedians. They are clumsy, messy, playful balls of joy wrapped up in fur and wiggly
                butts.</p>
