            <h2>Coding and Pet Lover</h2>
            <p>I am a full-stack web developer having more than 1 years of experience and having good knowledge of
                front-end
                and
                back-end techniques for building web applications that match client needs. I have developed some web
                applications
                from scratch but at the same time, I manage and update the client?s existing projects also as I have
                outstanding
                debugging skills. I love my dog as well. Because, my Dog are just natural comedians. They are clumsy,
                messy,
                playful
                balls of joy wrapped up in fur and wiggly butts.</p>

            <h2>Dream Big</h2>
            <h3>Became a Web Developer</h3>
            <p>My Dream of Becoming a Web Designer. As a young, my dream occupation was to dig up dinosaurs. As I grew
                older
                and
                my interests changed, my dream profession changed also. Although most of these dreams were not very long
                lived,
                one occupational dream has outlasted all others, and has finally emerged as the dream I passionately
                pursue.
